### Getting Help
Check the Issues section first to see if someone else has already reported this. If not, file an issue with steps on how to reproduce it, as well as a link to a file that triggers it. Post the sample file somewhere that doesn't require captchas or an account to access it (e.g. put it on Google Drive and set it accessible to anyone with the link). Also, the sample file should be posted somewhere without ads. Don't annoy the person you're asking to fix an issue for you.
